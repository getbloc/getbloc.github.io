Bloc is a new platform for bouldering, built by a team of boulderers and technologists. We're taking a step back to rethink the way bouldering content is distributed digitally, specifically solving how writers and area developers can share and monetize their content, and how we can better consume it on smartphones.

Whether you're a publisher, pro climber or amateur rock-fiddler &mdash; meet Bloc &mdash; your future best friend.

# Team
Bloc is being built from the ground up by a team of machine learning and UX design experts, Club Mate-enthusiasts and boulderers &mdash; hard at work shaping the future of bouldering.
